# EC504-Molecule-database
# Final Project Implementation 
# Molecule_Database Description:
Our project aims to present a molecule database, which stores structural properties and elemental composition of molecules. The project will be finished with the ability to efficiently handle at least 10,000 molecules and the ability to efficiently search for a given molecule up to graph isomorphism. A user-friendly web-based command-line interface and an Android client will be established to support the above functions.

## Basic Functionality 
### Overview

## Additional Feature Implementation:

### Download 1,000 known compounds from an existing database (e.g., [http://www.chemspider.com/AboutServices.aspx?][ChemSpider]]) into your molecular database.
PubChem is a freely available database of chemical structures of small organic molecules and information on their biological activities. We chose the PubChem API to we created the HttpURLConnection object to connect with URL as PubChem URL format. We pulled the data in a JSON format and used compound identifier(CID) as the input portion. The data is iterated through a for loop and increase ID by one each time until getting 1000 compounds.

### Ability to search for the most similar molecule to a given molecule, under some reasonable graph similarity metric.
### Implement subgraph search - finding all molecules(Gs) that contain a subgraph(SG) provided
### The following additional features have been removed from our Midterm Status Report:

Explanation: The involved scientists must be able to store this data and search it by chemical structure. We refer to the chemical structure of that model.

Explanation: This article presents the relational database EDULISS (Edinburgh University Ligand Selection System), which stores structural, physicochemical and pharmacophoric properties of small molecules. We will reference the algorithms they use.

Explanation: Molecules are in computers usually represented in the form of molecular graphs. This work starts with the definition of all required terms and then the problem of graph isomorphism is briefly described. We refer to the backtracking method to search for our molecule.

Explanation: PubChem is a key chemical information resource for the biomedical research community. It enables the function of Molecules name search and Isomers search, which is needed in our project. We will use PubChem to learn how to enable these functions.

[5] Alan Gibbons, Algorithmic Graph Theory. Cambridge University Press, 1985.
Explanation: As the requirement, molecules will be represented as an undirected multigraph without self-loops, whose vertices are labeled. In chemistry, a set of atoms combined with designated bonds are used to describe chemical molecules. Our project will store the chemical bonds of a module in a graph and store all of the graphs into a graph database. This reference is a textbook on graph theory, so we will use it to learn how to build the graph. database.

Explanation:Explanation: After building the graph database abovementioned, we aim to finish a function with which users can do subgraph query: Users input a query graph, we will find the modules containing matching subgraph in our graph database and return them.

Explanation: We decided to use the bootstrap framework to design UI. Here is a quick start on the website.
## Code:
All complete, working Java code used in our implementation.
