## Basic Functionality 
### Overview
## Additional Feature Implementation:
### Develop a stand-alone Graphical User Interface that provides molecular entry and search capabilities, database statistics, and also displays molecules in some reasonable graphic format.
### Download 1,000 known compounds from an existing database (e.g., [http://www.chemspider.com/AboutServices.aspx?][ChemSpider]]) into your molecular database.
### Ability to search for the most similar molecule to a given molecule, under some reasonable graph similarity metric.
### Implement subgraph search - finding all molecules(Gs) that contain a subgraph(SG) provided
### The following additional features have been removed from our Midterm Status Report:
